SFSIS

********
This project is an attempt to develop a SIS for Salesforce. This is being 
developed for a real-world scenario, non-profit, higher-ed, religious 
institution. It's not yet fit for any live purpose, and the code may only
be used if full credit is given to B.J. Murrey of bj@bjmurrey.com and you 
notify him of all code use in full or in part in other applications. You may
not sell this code.
